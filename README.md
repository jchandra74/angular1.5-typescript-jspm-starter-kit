#Angular 1.5 with TypeScript and JSPM Starter Kit

This is my attempt to create a starter kit for Angular 1.5 that uses jspm and TypeScript.

To start using this, just clone this repository using
```
git clone https://github.com/jchandra74/angular1.5-typescript-jspm-starter-kit.git
```

and run ```npm install``` afterward to restore all the neccessary dependencies.

To run the sample, just run ```npm start```.  This will launch the sample application.
